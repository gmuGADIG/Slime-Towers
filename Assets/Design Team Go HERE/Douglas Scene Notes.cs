Hopefully the object names are descriptive enough as a key

The ratio between the room's walkable width and length should be about 1.732, or the square root of 3.
This makes sure that enemies must cross a roughly equal amount of distance regardless from which spawn they come from.

I tried to limit the line of sight of towers, and to force enemies to take multiple paths. The design should also work well with in conjunction with the wall placing mechanic.
